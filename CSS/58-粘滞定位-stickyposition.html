    <p>This is a data exercise using World Bank Health data. You will need data on educational attainment for this, use the dataset Health WB.csv, available on OLAT. Make sure you have a dataset at the country-time level. There are country aggregates in the dataset, make sure you remove them before doing the analysis. Work on the period 1990-2010 only. You can find the labels of the variables in the document variables label.xlsx. You need to replace the name of the variables with their label for a clear understanding of your tables. You need to combine and present all of your results in well-formatted, easily readable tables. This means that you should not include a screenshot of the raw output from R or Stata. The results for the three regressions need to be in one unique table.</p>
